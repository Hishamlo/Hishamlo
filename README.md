Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Hishamlo, a begginer coder, currently working on developing my skills on PYTHON, I see the Programming and coding world as a new Metrapolis of knowledge,
It's the future of Mankind and advanced human technology, Coding makes smarter humans, better technology for everyone, and the best thing of it all is
learning it is FREE!!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PYTHON

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with anyone to be honest, I want to learn coding with a friend and we help each other!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Anything!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord: Hishamlo#3018

- âš¡ Fun fact: I Speak 2 Languages, English And Arabic. I'm Fluent At Both And Can Translate Whatever thing you want!

- âš¡ another Fun fact: Is i only have 1 year left to college and I really wanna master python in that time.

- ðŸŒ± My Dream Is: Being A Software Engineer Working at Google! :)

Obviously This is my first time making this acccount and was interested in this github fashion, so i said to my self why not build a better life for my children?
so i started learning coding and i still am.
